# Json to Go's struct.

Give [the tool (Live demo)](https://charnnarong.github.io/json-to-go-struct/ "Json to go struct") any valid JSON string 
and you will get Golang's struct(s) back that represent the inputted JSON.

-   Why does it exist?
    >   Coding is fun, but it turn bored hastily when one has to sacrifice their brain's cycle just for the sake of typing
     that isn't involve the main idea; parsing Go's struct from JSON by hand for instance!
       
-  The core code.
    >   The core code lives under `json-to-go-struct/src/logic/` project directory. It is free, open and it is all yours.
